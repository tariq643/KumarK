   /* We are given “n” type of items ; array b is given which tells us ->
    b[i] = frequency of item “i” ;

    Our task is to make a group of k distinct items;

    And finally output how many maximum such types of groups can be formed.

    [3 3 3] ; K = 2
    Output :- 4

    Observation : if you want to make y groups of size 'k': then sum of the array >= y*k

    Question is to find the maximum 'y'

    Brute force :

    first try for y = 1
    if it is possible for y = 1
    then try for y = 2;
    if yest try for y = 3 and so on .....
