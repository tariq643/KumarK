    Greedy vs Dynamic Programming
    two pointer is greedy algorithm

    if a problem can be solved by greedy approach
    it means that it is guaranteed that at each step
    you make a choice and that choice is best
    for now as well as the future ...
    then the problem can be solved using greedy method

    if there are multiple choice at each steps and it is not
    clear which choice will give better result long term
    then use dynamic programming
