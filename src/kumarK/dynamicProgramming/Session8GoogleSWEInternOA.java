Problem :- You are given an array of size “N” ;
you have to start your journey at index “1” and you need to end your journey at index “N”.

You can make jumps of size - 1 or 3 or 5

In the array positive as well as negative numbers can be available.

Please find the maximum sum of journey

[5 8 3 100 -5 -5 5 10]

O/P - 131

-> dp[] of size “N”

-> dp[i] = best answer to the question till index “i” -
best answer of the journey if journey is starting at index 1 and ending at index “i”

-> Try to find the formula.

-> Put the formula in the for loop

-> Analyze all the dp values; most probably dp[n] will be the final answer

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] + b[i] , dp[i-3] + b[i] , dp[i-5] + b[i])

dp[n] will be the final answer which tells you the maximum cost to reach index “n”.
